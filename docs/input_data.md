# Input data: files, formats and mandatory columns

All input files go into the working folder `data/` (`DATA_DIR`). File names are set in the data-loading cells of each notebook. If your files have other names, change them there (search for `safe_read_csv(`, `safe_read_excel(`, and `check_cols_before_load(`).

Each notebook first checks the **header row** of every input file for the mandatory columns (cell *Check if necessary columns exist…*). It stops with a clear error message if a column is missing. Column names are case-sensitive. Leading/trailing spaces in column names and in key text columns are removed automatically (Part 1, *Whitespace cleanup*). InChIKeys of all source databases and of the sample data are also cleaned automatically: converted to upper case, placeholders and numbers set to missing, and a digit "0" replaced by the letter "O" (Part 1, *InChIKey cleanup*).

**Terms used**
- **InChIKey** – a 27-character standard identifier of a chemical structure (e.g., `ZPUCINDJVBIVPJ-LJISPDSOSA-N`). Compounds are matched between samples and sources **only by InChIKey**; compound names are used for display only.
- **Source** – one product, food item or emission profile in a source database, described by its set of compounds.
- **Origin** – the database a source comes from (`HOUSEHOLD_PRODUCTS`, `LIT_CONSUMER_PRODUCTS`, `CPDAT`, `FOODB`, `SPECIATE`, `SPECIEUROPE`).
- **Kind / general category** – the two classification levels of a source used for the priors (for CPDat: product use category (PUC) kind and PUC general category; see below for the other databases).
- **Source class / source class domain** – two harmonized *reporting* levels across all origins (`source_class` = "Domain | Type", `source_class_domain` = "Domain"), assigned from a mapping file (section 3). They are used for tables and figures only, not for the priors or the optimization.

| File | Read by | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `Sample_Data.xlsx` | Part 1 | yes |
| `Own_Household_Products.csv`, `Own_Household_Products_Metadata.csv` | Part 1 | yes |
| `Literature_Products.csv` | Part 1 | yes |
| `CPDat/product_compositions.tsv`, `CPDat/products.tsv`, `CPDat/product_use_categories.tsv` | Part 1 | yes |
| `FooDB.csv` | Part 1 | yes |
| `SPECIATE.xlsx` | Part 1 | yes |
| `SPECIEUROPE.xlsx` | Part 1 | yes |
| `lookups/source_class_mapping.xlsx` | Part 1 | yes |
| `geo_metadata_outputs/household_metadata_priors.csv` | Part 2 | only if `USE_GEO_PRIORS = True` |

For testing, `example_data/` contains a complete synthetic set of all input files (sample data, household priors, small example versions of all six source databases with 60 sources each, and an example mapping file) in the same folder structure as `data/` ([example_data/README.md](../example_data/README.md)).

---

## 1. Sample data (Part 1)

| | |
|---|---|
| File | `Sample_Data.xlsx` |
| Format | Excel, first sheet; one row per detected feature (compound), one column per sample |
| Mandatory columns | `inchikey`, `Feature Name`, `Class`, `Concentration Type` |
| Sample columns | **All columns to the right of `Concentration Type`** are treated as samples. A value **> 0** means "compound detected in this sample"; empty/0 = not detected. Concentrations are not used, only presence/absence. |
| Sample IDs (column names) | `LLNN` with an optional suffix: `LL` = 2-letter sample code, `NN` = 2-digit sample number, e.g., `FR01`, `FR01_LS2`. `LLNN` (the ID without suffix) is the **sample key**: it matches the sample to its household priors (`household_id`) and to the own analyzed products with the same key (`LLNN_CPnn`); several samples from the same household or site share the key and differ only in the suffix. `LL` is used as the **sample group** in Part 3 and for the own-product factor in Part 2 (same `LL` = same group); in the INQUIRE data, `LL` is the country code. IDs in another format are used unchanged as key (they still match a `household_id` written in exactly the same way, but not own products); otherwise, adjust the function `household_key()` in Part 2. |
| Blank/QC columns | Blanks and QC samples are listed in `dust_cols_drop` in Part 1 (default examples: `7S_CS_01`, `Blank_NIST`, `FR_Field_Blank_01`, etc.) and removed when `DROP_QC_COLUMNS = True`. Replace the list with your own blank/QC column names if any. |
| Rows without InChIKey | Removed/dropped (they cannot be matched to sources). |
| Example | `example_data/Sample_Data.xlsx` (synthetic sample dataset) |

---

## 2. Source databases (Part 1)

The six source data sets are combined into one master contaminant source database (MCSDB). Each data set gets an ID suffix so that IDs from different databases can never collide.

**Presence/absence only.** The MCSDB records only *which* compounds occur in a source, not how much (no concentrations or weight fractions). The intermediate, cleaned versions of the public databases contain quantitative information where the original database provides it (section 2.7), but they are not redistributed here because of license terms (e.g., non-commercial use, redistribution needs permission). Users can rebuild the databases from the official releases with the cleanup pipelines listed in section 2.7, including concentrations/weight fractions (when available) for, e.g., clustering or multivariate analysis.

**Example files.** `example_data/` contains small versions of all six source databases (60 sources each; mostly synthetic, plus a few real rows) in exactly the formats described below, with the same file names and subfolders. Use them to test the pipeline or as templates for adding your own sources ([example_data/README.md](../example_data/README.md)).

### 2.1 Own analyzed household products – origin `HOUSEHOLD_PRODUCTS`

| | |
|---|---|
| Files | `Own_Household_Products.csv` (compounds per product); `Own_Household_Products_Metadata.csv` (product metadata) |
| Format | CSV, comma-separated, UTF-8 |
| Mandatory columns – products file | `MySysID`, `Brand-free Name`, `Feature_Name`, `InChIKey`; `source_kind`, `source_general_category`, `puc_harmonized` (used for priors; set to "Unknown" if absent); `Group3` (kept as source type) |
| Mandatory columns – metadata file | `MySysID`, `Group1`, `Group2`, `Group3` (the file is ID-suffixed and saved; not used further) |
| ID format | `MySysID` must be **`LLNN_CPnn`**, e.g., `FR01_CP04` (sample key FR01, consumer product 04). Part 1 adds `_HHP` → `FR01_CP04_HHP`. Part 2 reads the sample key from this ID (`FR01_CP04_HHP` → `FR01`) to prefer the products collected with that sample (household). IDs in another format get the factor for "another group" (`HH_OTHER_COUNTRY`). |
| Content | Compounds measured in products collected in INQUIRE households, e.g., plastic toys, personal care products, textile products, and analyzed using LC-MS-based non-target screening |

### 2.2 Consumer products from the literature – origin `LIT_CONSUMER_PRODUCTS`

### 2.7 How the source database inputs were prepared

The four public databases were downloaded in their official releases and cleaned, preprocessed, and harmonized with separate, published pipelines before they entered Part 1:

| Database | Version | Cleanup pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| CPDat | v4.0 | https://github.com/r3bryk/cpdat_v4.0_cleanup |
| FooDB | v1.0 | https://github.com/r3bryk/foodb_v1.0_cleanup |
| SPECIATE | v5.4 | https://github.com/r3bryk/speciate_v5.4_cleanup |
| SPECIEUROPE | v3.0 | https://github.com/r3bryk/specieurope_v3.0_cleanup |

**Compound identifiers.** InChIKeys of the compounds of all databases and literature publications were retrieved from PubChem with PubChem_Retriever (https://github.com/r3bryk/PubChem_Retriever), first described in Rebryk et al. (2026). Then, manual review and gap filling were done. This step is essential: all harmonization and all matching between samples and sources in INQUIRE_CSI use InChIKeys only.

**To rebuild the intermediate databases (e.g., with concentrations or weight fractions):**
1. Download the official release of each database (links in sections 2.3–2.6) and (if needed) convert them to appropriate formats used by the cleanup pipelines.
2. Retrieve InChIKeys with PubChem_Retriever, if the cleanup pipeline does not already do so.
3. Run the matching cleanup pipeline (table above), following its own README.
4. The resulting files have the formats that can be used by Part 1.

### 2.8 Optional columns for the all-compounds lookup

Part 1 also builds a lookup table of all compounds with their names, CAS numbers and DTXSIDs (`all_compounds_standardized.csv`; see [01_preprocessing.md](01_preprocessing.md), step 11). It uses the columns below if they exist. They are **optional**: a missing column is logged and skipped, and the identification is not affected. Column names can be changed in `COMPOUND_COLS`.

| Database (file) | Main name | Other names | CAS | DTXSID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Own household products (`Own_Household_Products.csv`) | `Feature_Name` | `Raw_Name`, `PubChem_Name` | `Raw_CAS` | `DTXSID` |
| Literature products (`Literature_Products.csv`) | `Feature_Name` | `Raw_Name`, `PubChem_Name` | `Raw_CAS` | `DTXSID` |
| CPDat (`product_compositions.tsv`) | `curated_chemical_name` | – | – | – |
| FooDB (`FooDB.csv`) | `orig_feature_name_cpd` | `feature_name_pubchem`, `iupac_name_pubchem` | `cas` | – |
| SPECIATE (`SPECIATE.xlsx`) | `Feature name` | `Name_Original` | `CAS#` | `DSSTox_ID` |
| SPECIEUROPE (`SPECIEUROPE.xlsx`) | `Feature name` | `Name_Original` | `CAS#` | – |

### Harmonized source schema (created by Part 1)

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `source_id` | Unique ID with database suffix (`_HHP`, `_COP`, `_CPD`, `_FDB`, `_SUS`, `_SEU`) |
| `source_name` | Human-readable name |
| `inchikey` | One compound of the source (one row per source × compound) |
| `source_origin` | Database (see above) |
| `source_kind` | Higher classification level (used for priors) |
| `source_general_category` | Lower classification level (used for priors and household-prior links) |
| `source_harmonized` | Full harmonized label (CPDat PUC style; for SPECIATE/SPECIEUROPE "level 1 \| level 2 \| level 3") |
| `source_class` | Reporting class "Domain \| Type" (from the mapping file, section 3) |
| `source_class_domain` | Reporting domain (first part of `source_class`) |

All columns of all output files are explained in the [codebook](codebook.md).

---

## 3. Source class mapping (Part 1)

| | |
|---|---|
| File | `lookups/source_class_mapping.xlsx` (inside `DATA_DIR`), sheet `source_class_mapping` – keep it as the **first** sheet, because the column check reads the first sheet |
| Format | Excel; one row per combination of `source_origin` × `source_kind` × `source_general_category` × `source_harmonized` |
| Mandatory columns | `source_origin`, `source_kind`, `source_general_category`, `source_harmonized`, `source_class`, `source_class_domain` |
| Use | Part 1 adds `source_class` and `source_class_domain` to every source. Missing key values are treated as "Unknown" on both sides, so they match. A key that appears twice with different classes stops the notebook. |
| Unmapped sources | Sources whose key is not in the file get `source_class` = "Unmapped Sources \| <origin>" and `source_class_domain` = "Unmapped Sources". Their keys are written to `lookups/source_class_unmapped.csv` (and `source_class_unmapped_std_dbs.csv` for the separate standardized databases). Add these rows to the mapping file and re-run Part 1. |
| Where to get it | `example_data/lookups/source_class_mapping.xlsx` |

---

## 4. Household priors (optional Part 2 input)

| | |
|---|---|
| File | `geo_metadata_outputs/household_metadata_priors.csv` (inside `DATA_DIR`) |
| Format | CSV, comma-separated |
| Columns | `household_id` (`LLNN`) + one `<module>_likelihood` column per module (29 in the INQUIRE data), values 0–1 (0.5 = average/no information) |
| Used when | `USE_GEO_PRIORS = True` in Part 2. With `False`, the file is not needed. |
| Example | `example_data/geo_metadata_outputs/household_metadata_priors.csv` (synthetic) |

The meaning of the modules, how they were built from the INQUIRE household data, and how to create your own file are described in [household_priors.md](household_priors.md).
